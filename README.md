# [ValFrame](https://valfra.me/)
A different way to beautify data.
This program extracts data from large JSONS and displays it while taking into account the hierarchy. It does it with the use of [depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) and the [breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) algorithms.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0 and is implemented as a [Single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).

## Push build to Gitlab Pages (branch gl-pages) and code to master
Run `./pushy <commit message>`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
